# world-clock

Just a quick clock app for finding out the time in different timezone, using [preactX](https://preactjs.com/)

## requirement

Let's think about what do I want with this app

* display your time (figure out what time zone as well?)
* add different type zone then display the clock (and date as well)
* let you specify a time (your timezone or different time zone) then work out the time
* it will be a PWA app
* allow you to save the selected timezone

## dependencies

* preactX
* bootstrap 4
* dayjs
